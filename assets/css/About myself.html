        <h1>About myself</h1>
        <p>My name is Judith Yakubu born on the 29th December into the family of Rev. Mrs Joshua Yakubu.
             I was given birth to in Lome Togo on a cold Thursday morning. 
             I enjoyed my stay in Togo for the first 10 years of my life until i returned to Nigeria in 2015.
             We returned to Nigeria and continued with life.</p>
        
        <h2>My Likes</h2>
        <p>I love music, eating, hanging out with friends, reading novels and anything that has to do with a computer.
            It has become a habit that i find myself doing everyday. And i really enjoy doing them.
            Most importantly i love fashion</p>        
        <h2>My Dislikes</h2>
        <p>Regardless of the fact i like hanging out with friends i find it disgusting when my friends betray me.
            I hate being forced to do things regardless of who it is. I hate fake friends and fake life.</p>
